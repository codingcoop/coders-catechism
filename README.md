# The Coder's Catechism

The Coder's Catechism is inspired by [Heilmeier's Catechism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._Heilmeier#Heilmeier.27s_Catechism). Heilmeier's Catechism is a series of questions to be answered when proposing a project.  The questions are designed to answer the questions of possible investors or organizational leadership.  The Coder's Catechism is a distilled version of this concept. It is meant to answer why the project may aid another coder in their project endeavours.  This catechim assumes that the project is a contribution to the open-source world and aims to properly follow the [Unix philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).
