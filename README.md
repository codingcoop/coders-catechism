# The Coder's Catechism

The Coder's Catechism is inspired by
[Heilmeier's Catechism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._Heilmeier#Heilmeier.27s_Catechism).
Heilmeier's Catechism is a series of questions to be answered when proposing a
project. The questions are designed to answer the questions of possible
investors or organizational leadership.

The Coder's Catechism is a distilled version of this concept. It is meant to
answer why the project may aid another coder in their own endeavours.  This
catechim assumes that the project is a contribution to the open-source world
and aims to properly follow the
[Unix philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).

Firstly, the catechim asks that you explain what it is that the project is
attempting to do. The core of the concept assumes that new projects must be
built upon previous ideas in order to be thoroughly understood. It also assumes
that there should to be an immediate demand for the implementation. Finally,
there should be a solid vision of the future of the project. In effect if you
can explain what the project is and offer context to its role when related to
the past, present and future it should make sense.

### What exactly is this project attempting to accompish?

### What pre-existing ideas does this project build upon?

### What immediate benefits can this project offer today?

### What impacts could this project have down the road?
