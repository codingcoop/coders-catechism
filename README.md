# The Coder's Catechism

The Coder's Catechism is inspired by [Heilmeier's Catechism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._Heilmeier#Heilmeier.27s_Catechism). Heilmeier's Catechism is a series of questions to be answered when proposing a project.  The questions are designed to answer the questions of possible investors or organizational leadership.  

The Coder's Catechism is a distilled version of this concept. It is meant to answer why the project may aid another coder in their own endeavours.  This catechim assumes that the project is a contribution to the open-source world and aims to properly follow the [Unix philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). 

The core of the concept assumes that new projects have to build upon previous ideas in order to be understood.  It also assumes that there has to be an immediate demand for the implementation.  Finally, there should be a solid vision of the the future of the project.  In effect it is three questions that answer the past, present and future.


### What existing ideas or patterns does this project build upon?

### What problems will this project immediately solve?

### What are the potential future uses of this project?
